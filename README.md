#### Hi everyone


I am Pranay Barkataki, currently working as a Data Scientist at Sony India Software Centre Private Limited. In my current role, I put together data preprocessing, data analysis, statistical analysis, machine learning, and deep learning models to draw insights that help to deliver value. The roles and responsibilities of my job are described below.
* Developed data preprocessing, interactive dashboards for Sony's recruitment team, ensuring data consistency and driving data-driven decisions.
* Conducted comprehensive data analysis on customer behavior and conversion patterns, leading to a
4% increase in membership conversion.
* Developed and deployed machine learning models to detect anomalies in manufacturing tools, resulting in a reduction of downtime by 2 hours
* Authored 6 tutorials and contributed high-quality code to Sony's esteemed Responsible AI GitHub repository

I am familiar with the following major data science skills,
 1. Python.
 2. SQL.
 3. Data Pipelines ETL (Extract Transform Load)
 4. Data Visualization
 5. Statistical Analysis
 6. Machine Learning ( Supervised, Unsupervised, and Clustering techniques), and building ML pipelines
 7. ML libraries: Sci-kit Learn, Keras, TensorFlow, Pytorch, HuggingFace, Pandas, NumPy.
 8. Deep Learning (CNN, RNN, Transformers, BERT, RNN, LSTM, YOLO, Transformers, LLMs)
 9. Natural Language Processing
 10. Computer Vision
 11. A/B testing
 12. Building recommendation engines
 13. Javascript
 14. Dockers
 
I have completed my Ph.D. from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur, India. My 6 years of research experience give me an added advantage of creating less technically driven compelling pitches and presentations for business purposes. As famously said by the great physicist Albert Einstein:
*"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."* 
I get excited about opportunities where I am able to leverage big data to discover insights and identify patterns to help businesses make decisions.

I have recently published a book in collaboration doctoral thesis guide, and the title of the book is [***An Object-Oriented Python Cookbook in Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Computing***](https://www.routledge.com/An-Object-Oriented-Python-Cookbook-in-Quantum-Information-Theory-and-Quantum/Ramkarthik-Barkataki/p/book/9781032256078). In this book, we developed a downloadable Python package for all quantum information and computation tasks.

**Hobbies**: I love to play Table Tennis, Video games, reading informative articles, and Artificial Intelligence.
