#### Hi everyone


My name is Pranay Barkataki, I have recently successfully defended my doctoral thesis at Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur, India. 
My research work was on quantum information , and quantum many body systems. My background in theoretical physics gives me a strong foundational understanding 
of the following fields, **statistics**, **linear algebra**, and **calculus**, and as we know that these fields are core ingredients in understanding any machine
learning model or performing any data science task. In the midst of my Ph.D., I came across the interesting paper written by Carleo Giuseppe on 
***“Solving the quantum many-body problem with artificial neural networks”***, which increased my curiosity in Deep Learning, and thereafter in the field of 
data science. From that day forward, I have just finished two of Udacity’s Nanodegree programs and received certificates - in Data Scientist Nanodegree, 
and SQL Nanodegree Program. That’s why I am familiar with following major data science skills,
 1. Python.
 2. Postgres SQL.
 3. Data ETL (Extract Transform Load)
 4. Machine Learning ( Supervised, Unsupervised, and Clustering techniques), and building ML pipelines.
 5. ML libraries : Sci-kit Learn, keras, TF.
 6. Artificical neural networks (CNN, RNN).
 7. NLTK.
 8. A/B testing.
 9. Building recommendation engines. 
 
As part of the Nanodegree programs, I have completed 4 projects in Data Science and 2 projects in SQL, which received good grades and were praised by reviewers.

Currently, in collaboration with my Ph.D. guide, we have written a book on ***Numerical Recipes in Quantum Information and Computation***. In this book, we
developed a downloadable Python package for all quantum information and computation tasks. This book is currently under communication with the CRC Press.

**Hobbies**: I love to read books, play table tennis and cricket.
