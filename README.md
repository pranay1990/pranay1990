#### Hi everyone


I am Pranay Barkataki, a Research Engineer at Sony India Software Centre Private Limited. In my current role, I put together data preprocessing, data analysis, statistical analysis, machine learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Generative AI to draw insights that help to deliver value. The roles and responsibilities of my job are described below.
* Innovated and developed cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to address bias in image generation, leading to a significant 17.2% performance improvement over previous models.
* Conducted comprehensive research and co-authored a paper comparing prominent Language Models (LLMs) to assess their code generation capabilities, utilizing both qualitative criteria and quantitative metrics.
* Maintained thorough documentation for code, models, and project processes, effectively communicated technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders, and contributed to a culture of knowledge sharing.

I am familiar with the following major data science skills,
 1. Python
 2. SQL
 3. Data Pipelines ETL (Extract Transform Load)
 4. Data Visualization
 5. Statistical Analysis
 6. Machine Learning
 7. ML libraries: Sci-kit Learn, Keras, TensorFlow, Pytorch, HuggingFace, Pandas, NumPy.
 8. Deep Learning 
 9. Natural Language Processing
 10. Computer Vision
 11. A/B testing
 12. Building recommendation engines
 13. Javascript
 14. Dockers
 15. Generative AI
 
I have completed my Ph.D. from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur, India. My 6 years of research experience give me an added advantage of creating less technically driven compelling pitches and presentations for business purposes. As famously said by the great physicist Albert Einstein:
*"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."* 
I get excited about opportunities where I am able to leverage big data to discover insights and identify patterns to help businesses make decisions.

I have recently published a book in collaboration doctoral thesis guide, and the title of the book is [***An Object-Oriented Python Cookbook in Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Computing***](https://www.routledge.com/An-Object-Oriented-Python-Cookbook-in-Quantum-Information-Theory-and-Quantum/Ramkarthik-Barkataki/p/book/9781032256078). In this book, we developed a downloadable Python package for all quantum information and computation tasks.

**Hobbies**: I love to play Table Tennis, Video games, reading informative articles, and Artificial Intelligence.
