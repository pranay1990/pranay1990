#### Hi everyone


I am Pranay Barkataki, currently working as a Data Analyst consultant at Sony India Software Centre Private Limited. In my current role, I put together data preprocessing, data analysis, statistical analysis, and machine learning models to draw insights that help to deliver value. Here are a few examples of my work:
1) Developed a dashboard for the TA team of the time duration for different stages of the interview process and the trend of the number of hired candidates from different partner companies. The dashboard enables the TA team to report and act on optimizing the duration of different interview stages and monitoring the performance of the partner companies.
2) Worked on customer data of Sony video editing software, where we statistically analyzed customer behavior and drew conclusions for customer conversion to a paid subscription.

I am familiar with following major data science skills,
 1. Python.
 2. SQL.
 3. Data Pipelines ETL (Extract Transform Load)
 4. Data Visualization
 5. Statistical Analysis
 6. Machine Learning ( Supervised, Unsupervised, and Clustering techniques), and building ML pipelines
 7. ML libraries : Sci-kit Learn, keras, TensorFlow, Pytorch, HuggingFace, Pandas, NumPy.
 8. Artificical neural networks (CNN, RNN, Transformers, BERT)
 9. Natural Language Processing
 10. Computer Vision
 11. A/B testing
 12. Building recommendation engines
 13. Javascript
 
I have completed my PhD from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur, India. My 6 years of research experience give me an added advantage of creating less technically driven compelling pitches and presentations for business purposes. As famously said by the great physicist Albert Einstein:
*"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."* 
I get excited about opportunities where I am able to leverage big data to discover insights and identify patterns to help businesses make decisions.

I have recently published a book in collaboration doctoral thesis guide, and the title of the book is [***An Object-Oriented Python Cookbook in Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Computing***](https://www.routledge.com/An-Object-Oriented-Python-Cookbook-in-Quantum-Information-Theory-and-Quantum/Ramkarthik-Barkataki/p/book/9781032256078). In this book, we developed a downloadable Python package for all quantum information and computation tasks.

**Hobbies**: I love to play Table Tennis, Video games, reading informative articles, and Artificial Intelligence.
